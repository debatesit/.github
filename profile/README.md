## What is DebateHub?
**DebateHub** is an online matchmaking platform that pairs users one-on-one to debate a wide range of world affairs topics.  
Each user is assigned an initial **Matchmaking Rating (MMR)** on their first visit. After every completed debate, this rating is adjusted based on how clearly, logically, and effectively the user explained and supported their arguments compared to their opponent.

## Why Make DebateHub?
The goal of DebateHub is to help users **improve their ability to articulate and defend their viewpoints**.

By pairing users in real-time, one-on-one debates:
- Debaters are encouraged to think critically and respond thoughtfully
- Competitive matchmaking motivates users to improve
- The MMR system provides tangible feedback by showing users how their skills evolve over time

DebateHub turns practice into progress and gives debaters the *“fruit of their labor”* through measurable growth.

## How DebateHub Works
DebateHub is built using a combination of **JavaScript**, **Python**, and several supporting technologies that enable real-time debates, intelligent matchmaking, and persistent data storage.

The platform is divided into three main layers: **Frontend**, **Backend**, and **Infrastructure & AI Resources**.

---

### JavaScript & Frontend Technologies
JavaScript powers the **entire client-side experience** of DebateHub.

- **React** is used to build a dynamic, component-based user interface
- **Node.js** supports frontend tooling and development workflows
- The UI is designed to be visually appealing, intuitive, and responsive
- Real-time updates ensure debates feel live and interactive

---

### Python & Backend Technologies
Python handles all **server-side logic and real-time communication**.

- **Flask** serves as the backend framework, managing API routes and application logic
- **WebSockets** enable real-time debate communication between users
- Matchmaking logic assigns opponents and manages debate sessions
- MMR calculations are performed after each debate to reflect user performance
- Core backend systems ensure smooth coordination between users and services

---

### AI, Data, and Infrastructure Resources
DebateHub integrates additional tools to enhance intelligence, scalability, and persistence.

- **DeepSeek** and **Ollama** are used for machine learning and AI-powered analysis
- **SQLite** provides lightweight, persistent data storage for users and matches
- **AWS** hosts and deploys backend services, enabling scalability and reliability

---

Together, these technologies allow DebateHub to deliver fast, competitive, and intelligent one-on-one debates in real time.
